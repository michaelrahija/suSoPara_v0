1. Why when "GroupDisabled" is the action, does an interviewid appear in the variable name column?


Functions
==========================

actionTable -> cleanMicro, reads data files and binds them together in single data frame. 
 -> each row in the df is an action on the tablet with the time and date stamp, and 
 - > time in seconds timeinsecond = d[i+1,time] - d[i, time]
-> problem when there are two comments set in a row, difficult to attribute to specific variable
-> maybe should group by variables, and then take a look at 


variableTable -> tabulation after clean micro, make independent function
	-> table by variable name
		-> compute n, mean, median, max, minimium, sd, also # of times the answer changed, # of time a question was commented


interviewPara <- 

Wish list from WB
===========================
It would be nice if SuSo exported a dataset that described each variable
 -> Could perhaps look at function to parse xml metadata
